Project Ideas:
-You are a parent. You have a daughter and a stay-at-home brother who helps take care of the household. Whatever pokemon you pick, 
your daughter picks the opposite. Then they go on the run, and you have to chase them across Hoenn.

-Indoors project. You are inside a tower and there's a tournament, or something.
