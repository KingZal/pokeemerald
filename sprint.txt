Remember, to open the project: open Powershell in Admin(?), run some update command to start Ubuntu, move to decomps folder using
cd Documents/decomps/pokeemerald-expansion (or something along those lines)

The setting: One big city, one big mountain, one port town. Easy! The question is, how are we going to fit in 
eight gyms and the elite four? Do we have to?


To-Do List:
-Fix trainer
-Remove gym badge requirements

Further down the road To-Do List:
-Go through a porymap tileset tutorial
-If not gym members, who?
-Create trainspotting side quest (can't test this until we unlock Dive)
-Can we edit metatile property for one in-game tile?

Exploration Ideas:
-Mark Renton: "I accidentally flushed my [key item] down the toilet. Can you help me fish it out?" 
Trainspotting reference - toilet (use placeholder for now) leads to underwater dungeon. 
-Seedy basements with ghost and poison pokemon
-Tougher pokemon like houndooms can be found in seedier parts of the city

Design Ideas: 
-Dark blue nighttime aesthetic, or use one of these https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Feature-Branches#Day-Night-Systems
    -If the former, imagine the city is in a permanent dusk or something
-Increased exp gain
    -"Your parental instincts have granted you a [better understanding of how to train] your pokemon."
-Three rooms per apartment floor, all of which have door signs (but not all of them are openable and/or occupied)

Kid Ideas:
-A villain (duh)
-A known villain
-On a quest to beat all eight region gyms. Eventually becomes the Elite Four champion.

Location ideas:
-Strip mall with a gym inside and some unusuable boutique stores
-Market District (where you can find move deleter, move reminder, etc.)
-A document forger. Forges you a trainer card with all eight badges once your child has 
-Hostel filled with visiting trainers. Changes after every gym badge, or some other important event
-Alleyways with more trainers and pokemon

Character ideas:
-

Script Ideas:
-Black screen followed by textbox showing baseball/football play by play
-Vanilla intro is followed up by black screen that says "Twenty years have passed. It is now the new generation's turn." 
    -("Or is it?")

Starters:
-Grass, Ground, Poison

Grass: Chikorita, Seedot
Poison: Ghastly
Ground: Larvitar

er...okay, how about: Larvitar vs. Gible vs. Ralts or Alolan Sandshrew ...no
But I edited Alolan Sandshrew to give him some better stats, later I'll give him new moves. Appears as though his learnset is different depending on the gen

https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/src/main_menu.c#L1484 for removing birch intro? haven't looked at it yet

Jealousy Ideas:
-You are a parent. You have a daughter and a stay-at-home brother who helps take care of the household. Whatever pokemon you pick, 
your daughter picks the opposite. Then they go on the run, and you have to chase them across Hoenn.
-Indoors project. You are inside a tower and there's a tournament, or something. 

"This is a hold up...give me your high school ring!"
"You know what I'd look like with blonde hair, Althea? Like a grilled cheese sandwich!"
