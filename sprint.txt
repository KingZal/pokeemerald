Remember, to open the project: open Powershell in Admin(?), run some update command to start Ubuntu, move to decomps folder using
cd Documents/decomps/pokeemerald-expansion (or something along those lines)

The setting: One big city, one big mountain, one port town. Easy! The question is, how are we going to fit in eight gyms and the elite four? Do we have to?

To-Do List:
-Create trainers
-Create real apartment interior
-Create trainspotting side quest

Exploration Ideas:
-Mark Renton: "I accidentally flushed my [key item] down the toilet. Can you help me fish it out?" 
Trainspotting reference - toilet (use placeholder for now) leads to underwater dungeon. 
-Seedy basements with ghost and poison pokemon
-Tougher pokemon like houndooms can be found in seedier parts of the city

Design Ideas: 
-Dark blue nighttime aesthetic, or use one of these https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Feature-Branches#Day-Night-Systems


Added carpet to protagonist's bedroom. Now to add secret side hallway with no music, with door that gives the message "You are not ready yet."
Still need to get poryscript working, apparently...

Location ideas:
-Strip mall with a gym inside and some unusuable boutique stores

Character ideas:
-

Starters:
-Grass, Ground, Poison

Grass: Chikorita, Seedot
Poison: Ghastly
Ground: Larvitar

er...okay, how about: Larvitar vs. Gible vs. Ralts or Alolan Sandshrew ...no
But I edited Alolan Sandshrew to give him some better stats, later I'll give him new moves. Appears as though his learnset is different depending on the gen

https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/src/main_menu.c#L1484 for removing birch intro? haven't looked at it yet

Jealousy Ideas:
-You are a parent. You have a daughter and a stay-at-home brother who helps take care of the household. Whatever pokemon you pick, 
your daughter picks the opposite. Then they go on the run, and you have to chase them across Hoenn.
-Indoors project. You are inside a tower and there's a tournament, or something. 

"This is a hold up...give me your high school ring!"
"You know what I'd look like with blonde hair, Althea? Like a grilled cheese sandwich!"
