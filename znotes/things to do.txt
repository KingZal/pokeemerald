The premise: Run errands around New Baltimore City while your daughter goes off on an epic pokemon adventure, 
beating Elite Fours and Battle Frontiers and tournaments around the world. She calls you on occasion to muse 
about her journey. In other words, this is the gist.
-You do a favor for somebody
-Your daughter calls to update you
-You do a favor for somebody
-Your daughter calls to update you
-You do a favor for somebody...

The setting: One big city, one big mountain, one port town. Easy! The question is, how are we going to fit in 
actual pokemon? We'll figure that out later...



To-Do List:
-Fix trainer
-Remove gym badge requirements
-Figure out fade to black
-Create trainer hotel
    -By extension, figure out how to appear/disappear trainers. One, two, three.

Things to do (wondertrade): 
-Use flags to give better pokemon over time
-Add daily limit
-Remove "equal level" aspect
-Consider...what if we just don't sell pokeballs? To avoid wondertrade spam?

Stuff I want to do: Create a rooftop map for protagonist's apartment building. Add new television scripts. 

Further To-Do List:
-Figure out how to apply custom palettes to NPCs
-Add more custom palettes, for skin tones I suppose

I ADDED A PHONE CALL! Wow.
