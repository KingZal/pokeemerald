I think I'm going to need a new tileset for the apartments, particularly the home apartment, to make them bigger
and include everything I want to add (computers, bookshelves, etc)

The home base should be something the player spawns back in frequently. Something that updates as the game goes on,
if that's possible. 



City itself needs a dark blue aesthetic if possible. If I set downpour on will that help?

Design Ideas: 
-Dark blue nighttime aesthetic, or use one of these https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Feature-Branches#Day-Night-Systems
    -If the former, imagine the city is in a permanent dusk or something
-Increased exp gain
    -"Your parental instincts have granted you a [better understanding of how to train] your pokemon."
-Three rooms per apartment floor, all of which have door signs (but not all of them are openable and/or occupied)

Alleyway dungeons. Maybe a shadow between buildings designate an area you can explore?
